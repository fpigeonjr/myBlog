## Motivation

The world wide web is a dark and scary place and if you want to protect your privacy and resist the man than a VPN(Virtual Private Network) may be for you.

Some Benefits that a VPN provides are:

- Anonymity
- Overcoming Geo-Location challenges
- Increased Security

I was not happy when I got a slap on the wrist from my ISP saying that I had made a copyright infringement and to _cut it out_.

âœŠ They had my ip address and everything so it was time to fight back.

Here are some good articles on _why_ you may need want a VPN.

## VPN Options

I started researching VPN options and found of a few subreddits of people raving about a few VPN providers.

**Nord VPN** had been a stand out from this [sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/as2cgo/whats_the_best_vpn_for_torrenting/).

PC Mag also did a great article comparing the major VPN.

## Setup

This guide is for **Ubuntu 18.04** and **NordVPN** but should work for any Debain-based system.

After you have signed up for your VPN, make sure you have your credentials handy. You will need them soon.

First thing you do is pull down the latest NordVPN file from their site.

```bash

my awesome bash command that gets the file

```

Next, update your apt.

```bash

sudo apt update

```

Now install nordvpn.

```bash

sudo apt install nordvpn

```
