## Motivation

The world wide web is a dark and scary place and if you want to protect your privacy and resist the man than a VPN may be for you.

Some Benefits that a VPN provides are:

* Anonymity
* Overcoming Geo-Location challenges
* Increased Security

I was not happy when I got a slap on the wrist from the ISP saying that I had made a copyright infringement and to *cut it out*.

âœŠ They had my ip address and everything so it was time to fight back.

Here are some good articles on why you may need want a VPN.

## VPN Options

I started researching VPN options and found of a few subreddits of people raving about a few VPN providers.

**Nord VPN** had been a stand out from this [sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/as2cgo/whats_the_best_vpn_for_torrenting/).
