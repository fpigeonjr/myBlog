This week I was thinking that it would be fun to have a place to share my book reviews for the books I have completed this year. But here's the catch: _there will be a limitation of three sentences_.

## When Breath Becomes Air


by Paul Kalanithi

A neurosurgeon with a brilliant future finds out he has terminal cancer in his thirties. In this unfinished memoir, he must find out what is truly important in life while facing death. This book is gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and teaches us about how to live.
