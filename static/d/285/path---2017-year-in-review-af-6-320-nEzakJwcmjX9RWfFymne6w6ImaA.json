But which framework to start with? I was overwhelmed and did what I thought was best and that was to spend a little time with each one.</p>\n<p>I started with Angular since it was hyped from VS Studio Live Conference I had attended in Austin, TX. It paired nicely with Typescript and seemed like many speakers at the conference where talking about it. I listened to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deborahkurata\">Deborah Kurata</a> speak and how the Angular team all used vscode and how the Google team was working with the MS team. Seemed like a good place to start but I had found that it was not a rabbit hole that I wanted to go down.</p>\n<p>Next I moved onto Vue since Jeffrey Way had realeased a course on <a href=\"https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step\">Learning Vue 2 Step by Step</a>. I really love Jeffrey’s teaching style and respect him as a teacher and a person.  I really liked how simple it was to get started. No complicated setup needed.</p>\n<p>Next I was introduced to Wes Bos and his online courses, some free and some paid. I found that he had great quality training after taking some of the 30 Day JS Challenge. I soon started his <a href=\"https://reactforbeginners.com/\">React for Beginner’s</a> course and really liked that React is just JS and felt that by learning React it was making me a better JS developer too.</p>\n<p>Then my coworker used React on one of our projects at work and I remember thinking this <strong>feels like magic</strong>. I was hooked ever since. I want to continue learning React in 2018 and this is where my heart is after trying the big three JS frameworks in 2017.</p>\n<p>I feel like it was good for me to at least try all 3. Not at the same time, but complete one project in one framework and see how it felt. Then you can make a decision on which one you like working with, wich one you feel comfortable with, and which one you are most productive with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dokku\"><a href=\"#dokku\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Dokku</h3>\n<p>I probably need to do a seperate blog post on <a href=\"http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/\">Dokku</a> to give it justice.</p>\n<p>From the docs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Docker powered mini-Heroku. The smallest PaaS implementation you’ve ever seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had not worked with Heroku but have read that it makes deploying apps in whatever language dead simple.</p>\n<p>I was using <a href=\"https://forge.laravel.com/\">Forge</a> but I was limited to PHP based projects. Now that I am using Dokku, I can deploy apps in any language to my Digital Ocean droplet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interviews\"><a href=\"#interviews\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Interviews</h3>\n<p>My dev shop was hiring two developer positions and I was selected to be on the interview panel. It was the first time I had been on the other side of the table and was honored to be there. We were asked to come up with five questions and the panel, which consisted of four members would take turns asking questions.</p>\n<p>This experience helped me remember that this field is hard, and being put on the spot to answer technical questions can be daunting task to say the least. I have been in those shoes and know that it can be tough.</p>\n<p>I remember from being on a Army promotion board that even if you dont’ know the answer, say you know where to find the answer. Also enthusiasm goes along way. People skills are important since you will have to work with this person.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-upgrades\"><a href=\"#best-upgrades\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Best Upgrades</h2>\n<p>2017 had a many upgrades but these are top favs!</p>\n<h3 id=\"standing-desk\"><a href=\"#standing-desk\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Standing Desk</h3>\n<p>I had the opportunity to get a standing desk for work. At first, I wasn’t sure if I even wanted it but I decided that I would give it a try.</p>\n<p>I had read of the benefits of standing and was trying to improve my health so this was a win for me.</p>\n<p>At first my legs would get weak and I could only stand for like maybe an hour or so. But after a few weeks, I was standing more and sitting less.</p>\n<p>Now I find that I am standing all morning, and then sit down for lunch and the afternoon.</p>\n<p>I also gave up my chair for a medicine ball and feel that I am working my core more now than just sitting in a chair.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exercise-as-part-of-my-routine\"><a href=\"#exercise-as-part-of-my-routine\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercise as part of my routine</h3>\n<p>I wasn’t in the habit of working out and had found that I even when I went to the gym I wasn’t very seriuos about it.</p>\n<p>Now I am commited to working out as part of my day.
