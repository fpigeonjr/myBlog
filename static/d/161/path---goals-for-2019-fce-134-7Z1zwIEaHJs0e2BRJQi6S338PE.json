It is definitely one of the greatest books of 2018.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In one of the early chapters James says to forget about goals and focus rather on the systems that will get you to reach your goals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have set goals before and while I have reached many of them, I probably have failed to reach many more of them. So instead of goals, I am going to focus on <strong>habits</strong>( aka systems) instead of goals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>üî•You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"1-spiritual-life\"><a href=\"#1-spiritual-life\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1.
