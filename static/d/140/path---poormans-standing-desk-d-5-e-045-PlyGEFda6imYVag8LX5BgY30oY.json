The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VARIDESK-Height-Adjustable-Standing-Desk-Pro/dp/B00BBFXBF4\">official Veridesk ones</a> are like a grand and even the one that you put on top of your existing desk runs $300. So yeah, not in my budget at all. Probably need a stool kinda thing in case I get tired standing as well, the veridesk one is insane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"standing-desk-build\"><a href=\"#standing-desk-build\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Standing Desk Build</h2>\n<!-- TODO: Add image -->\n<p>I’ve been wanting a standing desk for some time but was always put off since it was so expensive. I have a regular siting desk for many years but since we got Veridesk at work I’ve enjoyed the health benefits and been wanting one for my home office as well.</p>\n<p>So I looked around and found that there was an Ikea hack where you could build your own for ~$20. I was so happy that I wanted to see if I could pull it off. If it didn’t work out it was just $20 bucks and little bit of my time so no biggie.</p>\n<p>Another problem I faced was that the pieces were from Ikea but the closest one is in Austin which is ~ 2hrs drive. <em>I didn’t feel like spending 4 hours in the car to I could save a few bucks</em>.</p>\n<p>So while we were at Walmart looking around, I took a look around to see if I could find similar materials to make the standing desk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"materials\"><a href=\"#materials\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Materials</h3>\n<p><img src=\".end-table.jpg\" alt=\"end table from Walmart\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-Parsons-End-Table-Multiple-Colors/47827019\">end table(monitor stand), $12</a></li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> shelf(keyboard and mouse), $6</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled> brackets(to put them together), $5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found a end table in Walmart’s furniture isle.
